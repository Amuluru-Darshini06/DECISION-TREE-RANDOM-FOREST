# DECISION-TREE-RANDOM-FOREST


## 🌿 Domain-Aware Tree-Based Modeling with Decision Trees & Random Forests

### 🎯 A Hands-On Guide to Feature Engineering & Interpretability in Machine Learning

This notebook provides an end-to-end walkthrough of **feature engineering and model development** using **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**, with a strong focus on leveraging **domain knowledge** to guide data preparation, model construction, and evaluation.

Rather than relying purely on automated tools, this workshop emphasizes **understanding your data** and applying human insight to build more interpretable and robust models—especially important in real-world use cases like healthcare, finance, agriculture, or manufacturing.
